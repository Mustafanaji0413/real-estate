## Target Group 
MN Real Estate has mainly two target groups, customers seeking a new home and customers wanting to sell their home. We are confident that our reputation and marketing strategies will lead to more customers wanting to partner with us when hearing about what we have accomplished. 

### Buying Customers
The real estate market is one of the safest and most profitable markets out there. With turnovers of trillions of dollars each year it is a lucrative market to jump into. MN Real Estate is here to help first-time buyers and veterans in the field. We are here to help buyers have a great experience selling their homes and get the most value for it!


### Selling Customers
Together with our reputation and our marketing strategy, using major social media platforms and their algorithms to target home-interested buyers. We are confident that MN real estate and our modern marketing strategy will attract new customers and make current customers stay. 


#  User Experience Design

To better understand the customer journey I have written an example of what it could look like. 

## The story of the Andersson

The Andersons have for a long time been looking to buy a new home and sell their current house. But with the large jungle of different real estate companies and promises they all make, it has been difficult to make the decisions of what real estate company the Andersons should partner with. 

While scrolling online the Andersson came across an ad about MN Realestate. By partnering with some of the biggest social media platforms MN Realestate has been able to use its algorithm to target individuals that have shown interest in real estate reels and posts. 

The Andersson clicked on the ad shown and started to read more about MN Realestate and the approach they are taking to sell their listings and comfort customers. Along with reviews and recommendations, the Andersons decided to browse our website to possibly find a home matching their needs.

After some research and consideration, Andersson found a home that was perfect for them. After reading more about the listing, they could easily contact the realtor responsible by filling out a simple form. 

The Realtor got back in contact with them and the process of buying a new home is well on its way.

## The surface Plane

### Base

To make the application as dynamic as possible, I want the navbar and footer to be the same in all of the applications. Therefore, Django dynamic pages are used so the user always recognizes the default layout they're on.

#### Navbar
<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 16 36" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210862368-accfc081-22c9-4eb4-b46b-ca362358ace1.png">


#### Footer
<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 17 04" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210862416-04146498-cc5c-4c40-8bba-88f8d23ff67f.png">


### Home page

    A major key for us is to not distract the user away from the purpose of them visiting the website. We do not want to make it difficult for them to find what they need and scare them off. That's why we have chosen to make the search bar and filtering options the first thing the user sees. 

<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 17 12" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210862450-4cfdf053-3343-4038-a5d4-904cb9c7b6cb.png">


 When the user scrolls down we present them with the latest listings that have been posted to keep them engaged. On each listing, there is a call to action button to read more about the listing as well.

<img width="1439" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 18 33" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210862587-24a2017d-648e-4116-b205-f8093995619d.png">


 Further down on the home page, we have chosen to display three main focuses we at MN real estate focus on. We have opted to do so to keep the user intrigued with the capabilities of our company. 

<img width="1434" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 18 47" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210862623-4b3cc3c2-9484-48ee-b6df-c63e1ac76661.png">
 

 ### About Page

 When you first visit the about page, the first thing you are greeted with is more about us at MN Real Estate. You get to read more about our accomplishments and what services we provide along with further information about customer reviews. On the left side of the about page, we also show the realtor of the month to further interest the user and encourage our staff.  

 <img width="1439" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 20 06" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210862870-623f2bd2-ce1e-4c4e-81ef-6d643a345f1a.png">


 Further down on the about page, we have also added a quote that says "We Work For You!" in an attempt to get them to browse our listings. In that section is a call to action button that takes them directly to our featured listings page so the user doesnÂ´t have to scroll up to go there. 

 <img width="1432" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 20 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210862899-43947160-6689-4564-841f-9e9675f17e6a.png">


 At the bottom of our about page, users can find our qualified team and more information about them. This is in an attempt to get a visual understanding of the realtors to better build a bond instead of them possibly only seeing a name. 

 <img width="1435" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 20 27" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210862931-c2fe19af-7048-4a84-b366-2e72e83a5592.png">


 ### Featured Listings Page
 
 On our featured listings page the user gets to see all of our listings if the user decides not to filter them. Here the user can jump between pages and read more about each listing that catches their interest. 

 <img width="1431" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 21 37" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210863046-306d2b25-4b69-46b7-ae99-b7b1590b295b.png">


  ### Register Page
  On the navbar, the user has the option to register to keep track of what listings they have shown interest in. To sign up, the user needs to fill out a couple of basic details. 

  <img width="1429" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 22 18" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210863112-7e7ee01b-72db-4312-8f63-bd8ab30ccf02.png">

  ### Dashboard Page
 On the dashboard page, a logged-in user sees what listings they have shown interest in and sent an inquiry. This makes it easier to keep track of interesting listings and makes for a better user experience. 

<img width="1421" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 23 48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210863355-e457d3c0-9d23-41e7-af97-21c63fb7c893.png">


 ### Make An Inquiry page
  
  On the Make An Inquiry page the logged in user can make an Inquiry and get in touch with the correct realtor for the listing to get more info and proceed in the process of buying a home. The Name and email of the user is prefilled when making a Inquiry for a better user experiance. 

  <img width="1437" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 24 53" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210863516-6a6e4f0d-b5c8-4175-aaf4-5c195fb5cb07.png">


  ### Add a listing. 
  As an admin, you can choose to create a brand new listing. To do this you need to fill out the listing information and other valid details to be able to post it. 

  <img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 20 25 32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115544231/210863618-d61601ba-0e84-4c87-903f-e35d23e94554.png">

- Click the Create Repository from Template to create your repository.
- Click the Gitpod button to create a gitpod workspace, this can take a few minutes.
- When working on a project using Gitpod, please open the workspace from Gitpod, this will open your previous workspace rather than creating a new one.
- Use the following commands to commit your work, git add . - adds all modified files to a staging area.

git commit -m "A short message explaining your commit" - commits all changes to a local repository.

git push - pushes all your committed changes to your GitHub repository.

- Before making the first commit: PLEASE MAKE SURE NEVER TO PUBLISH SECRET KEYS, ADD THE env.py TO A .gitignore TO AVOID PUSHING KEYS TO GITHUB.
